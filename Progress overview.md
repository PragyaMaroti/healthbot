   # MONTH 1 :
   
   ## Week  1:
   
  - All four team members from four different colleges were introduced to each other by Ankit sir. We decided to build a Contextual AI chatbot, using rasa . Rasa is an open source AI Framework,used  for building chat and voice based virtual assistants.
- We all started gathering information about rasa framework, through its documentation, youtube videos  and then we discussed about all the resources.
- we learnt the concept of scrum and agile methodology. The Daily Scrum Meeting is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the  team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
- Agile software development refers to  software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.
 - After learning the concepts , our next step is to decide which chatbot we shall build. We made a google doc to write and share our ideas . 
- We started reading about rasa framework and its components and started researching on our ideas to decide which chatbot shall we build with complete guidance.

   ## Week  2:
   - We continued to gather ideas which included a bot that could suggest courses, a bot that could provide information about vaccination and locate its centers. We also continued to research  about  this technology as this was completely new to us, so we decided to move forward with a guided project . We chose a weathterbot to start with.
   -  We started following  the resources of weatherbot  and got to know that few links are broken and with that we could not move ahead.
   -  We again looked for another suitable resource and with the help of Rasa's udemy videos and documentation for newer version , we decided to build a chatbot that can     maintain a user's health records on a daily basis .
   -  We started to get some basic information about rasa through the udemy course and also started to refer documentation by Rasa.
   -  Meanwhile, some members were facing issues with installation and some members were looking for an alternative for installation of rasa on google collab .


------------------------------------------------
 

## Week 3:

- We faced timing issue for our dsm, as all the members were not available at a particular common time due to temproary changes in their schedules
- We found that installation will be a better option for us as the latest version of Rasa was not available with google collab. 
- We documented the installation commands used in a shared document with us.
- We all took our time to gain basic knowledge of NLU, actions and domain in the folllowing days from the documentation and video.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Week 4:
- We made personal progresses till now in terms of learning.
- We discussed about making the learning accessible to everyone of us with a shared repository.
- We divided the work of making the basic nlu file domain file, rules file and story file among us.
- We got advised to make a progress file and we discussed about it to give it a go.
- We also decided to document the concepts that in the previous week and accordingly divided the work.
- At the end, we had a retrospective meeting for the first month.

how to write the actions better. So, we started to learn about python, specially about the related terms in the file.
